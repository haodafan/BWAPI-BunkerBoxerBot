# Bunker Boxer Bot - An AI project for Starcraft Brood War

The Bunker Boxer Bot is an AI which plays starcraft through the [BWAPI](https://github.com/bwapi/bwapi) library. 

# About Starcraft 

[Starcraft](https://starcraft.com/en-us/) is a classic Real-Time Strategy game developed by Blizzard Entertainment. 

Real-Time Strategy (RTS) is a genre of videogames that can be thought of like Chess but in real time (no turns). 

RTSes like Starcraft involve building structures, managing an economy, creating an army, and using that army to destroy the army of your opponent. 

## Breaking down the Game 

Starcraft, and many other real-time strategy games, can be thought of as a collection of a dozen or so minigames happening at the same time. This makes it intuitive to divide the AI into different components, each managing its own 'minigame'. 

There are three main components (or minigame 'categories') to Starcraft. 

1. Macro (economy)
2. Micro (control)
3. Grand Strategy 

### 1. Macro 

Macro is the economy portion of the game. There are three main resources in Starcraft - Minerals, Gas, and Supply. 

Minerals/Gas are basic resources which are generated by worker units gathering from Mineral fields and Vespene geysers. These resources are required for building buildings and army units. 

# Our AI - the Bunker Boxer Bot 

## Inspiration 

SlayerS_BoxeR was one of the first well-known Starcraft pro-gamers. He was a Korean player well known for his aggressive playstyle and flawless micro. 

Famously, he often liked to use the "Bunker rush" strategy against his Zerg opponents.
