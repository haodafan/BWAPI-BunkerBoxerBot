Re-vamp unit management system : 
	- New struct type : Unit 
	- Give each unit a set of tags and stances (i.e. "marine", "worker", etc) 
	- 

Replace all "attack closest unit" code with one which priorities certain targets

Different approaches to attacking Zerg, Terran, Protoss 
Zerg: Build bunker at chokes or right outside creep 
Protoss: Different approach when dealing with Photon Cannons 

[LATE] Scout for proxies and deal with them accordingly
